Calculator for iOS in swift

Hello guys, it's my first project with swift and swiftUI. for first project I decided to take a calculator for iPhone and iPad.
Now this calculator works with all buttons, but it looks much better on iPhone screen (I anderstood Steven's Jobs decizion to don't add a calculator on iPad)
Maybe after fixing a split view and using it with floating window I will upload it to app store
